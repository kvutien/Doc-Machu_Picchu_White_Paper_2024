This is Part 4, describing how we start in Machu Picchu. 

## How do we start?
In Part 1, we have seen the pains of humanitarians and the possible solutions using 21st century technologies. [*See Part 1 (pains and solutions) here (link)*](./README_1.md). 

In Part 2 we have listed the acute needs of humanitarians actions and how they are currently very imperfectly solved. [* See Part 2 (acute needs) here (link)*](./README_2.md).

In Part 3 we do a deep dive in to the above use case and how they can be solved with 21st century tools. [*Part 3 (use cases) here (link)*](./README_3.md).

Now comes the question "*How do we start?*"
